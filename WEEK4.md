# Week 4: Advanced Analysis, Hyperparameter Tuning, and Extended Evaluation  
*Dates: 3/9/25 – 3/16/25*

Building on our fully integrated baseline pipeline from Week 3, Week 4 shifts the focus to deepening our analyses, fine-tuning our models, and performing a comprehensive evaluation of our approaches. This week, our goals are to optimize model performance, refine our feature extraction methods, and strengthen our understanding of the neural correlates driving our predictions.

## Common Tasks for All Projects

1. **Enhanced Evaluation Metrics:**
   - **Task:** Expand the evaluation framework to include metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score (for classification tasks), R², and mean absolute error (for regression tasks).  
   - **Action:** Update `model_training.py` to compute and log these metrics. Create summary visualizations (e.g., confusion matrices, error distributions) and document insights in a new file, `Evaluation_Metrics_Report.md`.

2. **Cross-Validation & Robustness Checks:**
   - **Task:** Implement k-fold cross-validation for all model training procedures to ensure robustness.
   - **Action:** Modify your notebooks and scripts to include cross-validation loops and record performance variability across folds. Summarize findings in `Cross_Validation_Results.md`.

3. **Documentation & Code Refinement:**
   - **Task:** Review and update all documentation to reflect the advanced evaluation steps and any modifications to the pipeline.
   - **Action:** Ensure consistency across markdown documents (e.g., update `Project_Goals.md` and `Preprocessing_Steps.md`) and commit code refinements.

## Project 1: Predicting Engagement from EEG Signals

1. **Model Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - **Task:** Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for both the logistic regression and shallow neural network models.
   - **Action:** Use grid search or randomized search techniques to identify optimal hyperparameters. Document tuning experiments and results in `Project1_Hyperparameter_Tuning.md`.

2. **Error Analysis and Feature Importance:**
   - **Task:** Perform an in-depth error analysis of engagement predictions.
   - **Action:** 
     - Analyze misclassified or poorly predicted instances.
     - Use techniques like SHAP values or permutation importance to determine which EEG features are most predictive.
     - Save visualizations as `engagement_error_analysis.png` and add discussion to `Project1_Pipeline_Evaluation.md`.

3. **Model Robustness Tests:**
   - **Task:** Assess model performance under various noise conditions or data subsampling scenarios.
   - **Action:** 
     - Create a notebook (`engagement_robustness.ipynb`) that simulates different noise levels.
     - Analyze the degradation (or stability) of model performance and report findings.

## Project 2: Decoding Musical Content from EEG Signals

1. **Advanced Signal Representation:**
   - **Task:** Enhance the musical content decoding model by exploring deeper architectures (e.g., CNNs or RNNs) tailored for time-series data.
   - **Action:** 
     - Develop a new model prototype in `musical_content_advanced_model.ipynb`.
     - Compare its performance against the baseline using the enhanced evaluation framework.
     - Document performance metrics and save key output plots as `musical_content_advanced_performance.png`.

2. **Refinement of Time-Frequency Analysis:**
   - **Task:** Fine-tune the parameters for STFT and wavelet transforms to better capture the dynamics of musical elements.
   - **Action:** 
     - Update `time_frequency_analysis.ipynb` with experiments on various window sizes and frequency resolutions.
     - Save refined spectrograms as `advanced_spectrogram.png` and note observed improvements.

3. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - **Task:** Investigate correlations between extracted EEG features and specific musical elements.
   - **Action:** 
     - Develop statistical models or visualizations (e.g., correlation heatmaps).
     - Summarize key correlations and their potential implications in `Musical_Feature_Correlation.md`.

## Project 3: Comparative Analysis of Models

1. **Detailed Comparative Metrics:**
   - **Task:** Deepen the comparison between engineered features and raw data models by introducing additional statistical tests (e.g., paired t-tests) on performance metrics.
   - **Action:** 
     - Update `Pipeline_Comparison_Week3.md` with new metrics and comparative plots.
     - Document any statistically significant differences and potential reasons.

2. **Latent Space Analysis:**
   - **Task:** Enhance latent space visualization to explore the representations learned by both pipelines.
   - **Action:** 
     - Extend `latent_space_visualization.ipynb` to incorporate multiple dimensionality reduction methods (t-SNE, UMAP).
     - Save updated plots as `latent_space_comparison_week4.png` and provide detailed annotations in the notebook.

3. **Integration of Interpretability Techniques:**
   - **Task:** Apply interpretability methods (e.g., activation maximization, feature attribution) to both pipelines.
   - **Action:** 
     - Create a section in `Comparative_Approaches.md` discussing which neural features or EEG markers are most influential in each pipeline.
     - Include visualizations and brief interpretations of the findings.

By the end of Week 4, our aim is to have a thoroughly optimized and well-documented set of models for each research task. This iterative refinement and comprehensive evaluation will set a strong foundation for subsequent experimental enhancements. Let's focus on solidifying these advanced analyses and ensure that our insights are clearly captured and reproducible.

Happy refining and evaluating!
